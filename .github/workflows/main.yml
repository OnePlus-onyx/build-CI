# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - id: build
        run: |
          echo 12345

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run_script
        continue-on-error: true
        run: |
          echo Hello, world!
          exit 124

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo ${{ steps.name.step1.exitcode }}
          echo ${{ steps.build.outputs.Run_script }}
          echo test, and deploy your project.
